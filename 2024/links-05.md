- [An Object-Oriented Language for the '20s](https://web.archive.org/web/3/https://adam.nels.onl/blog/an-oo-languge-for-the-20s/) \
Adam Nelson remixes the good ideas from various modern programming languages and proposes what an object-oriented language designed for the present-time should be.

- [Ed Catmur’s Triliteral esolang](https://web.archive.org/web/3/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2024/03/31/ed-catmurs-triliteral/) \
Arthur O’Dwyer describes Triliteral, an esoteric programming language invented by prolific C++ contributor Ed Catmur, which is inspired by how words are created in Semitic languages by weaving vowels through triconsonantal roots.

- [The origin and virtues of semicolons in programming languages](https://web.archive.org/web/3/https://ntietz.com/blog/researching-why-we-use-semicolons-as-statement-terminators/) \
Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya wades through computer science history trying to find the when and why of the wide use of the humble semicolon in many programming languages.

Dmitriy Kubyshkin explains are how type checking in statically typed programming languages is like evaluation of a secondary program in dynamically typed languages.

In this comprehensive guide, Miguel Young tells us everything there is to know about the art and science of linking to create executables.

- [Garbage Collection for Systems Programmers](https://web.archive.org/web/3/https://bitbashing.io/gc-for-systems-programmers.html) \
Matt Kline argues that it is okay to use garbage collection with system programming languages because modern garbage collectors have amazing throughput.
