<figure markdown="1">
> "The difficulty with music is that half of it is arbitrary and half of it is actually based on something, but you can’t tell the difference just by looking at it."
<figcaption markdown="1">
<cite markdown="1">[Music Theory for Nerds](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/09/15/music-theory-for-nerds/)</cite>[🏛️](https://web.archive.org/web/3/https://eev.ee/blog/2016/09/15/music-theory-for-nerds/ "Archived link")

<figure markdown="1">
> "Defining the original paths for those letters was a very manual process of writing their positions into the code and then nudging the points back and forth until the letters looked right. When it came to coding cursive, I streamlined the process."

<figure markdown="1">
> "Are there deeper, more fundamental aspects of software that can help us think beyond surface-level matters? I’ve come to think that a triad of interacting factors best explains what software is and, by extension, why software is difficult."
<figcaption markdown="1">
<cite markdown="1">[What Factors Explain the Nature of Software?](https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2024/what_factors_explain_the_nature_of_software.html)</cite>[🏛️](https://web.archive.org/web/3/https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2024/what_factors_explain_the_nature_of_software.html "Archived link")
