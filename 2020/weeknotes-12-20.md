# Notes for the week

In the week of 14thâ€“20th December 2020, I

- once again, spent most of my free time [solving Advent of Code problems](/2020/aoc-wk3),
- went out for a [few long walks](https://abhinavsarkar.net/activities/) around the neighbourhood,
- had a minor back injury while exercising, causing me to rest on the weekend, and
- celebrated my birthday with a long walk followed by eating a muffin.
