# Notes for the week

In the week of 7thâ€“13th December 2020, I

- spent most of my free time [solving Advent of Code problems](/2020/aoc-wk2) and doing [workouts](https://abhinavsarkar.net/activities/),
- continued listening to [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35300537-the-left-hand-of-darkness) audiobook,
- started reading [The Travelling Cat Chronicles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961230-the-travelling-cat-chronicles) which is the book of the month in my book club,
- went out for few walks around the neighbourhood,
- received [this cool mechanical keyboard](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Mini-Good-in-Blue) I ordered for my wife, and
- felt less anxious than before, thanks to the falling number of [COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru](https://covid19.bbmpgov.in/).
