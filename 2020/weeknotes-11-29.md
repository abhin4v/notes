# Notes for the week

In the week of 23rdâ€“29th November 2020, I

- discovered the beautiful [Kasavanahalli Lake](https://goo.gl/maps/muZow8hFMmRdXU439) not very far from my home,
- started listening to the audiobook of [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35300537-the-left-hand-of-darkness) by Ursula K. Le Guin,
- discarded my dying Pixel 1 phone and started using a Moto X4 phone,
- took a day off work to enjoy the chilly weather of Bangalore,
- stated working out again,
- went to a (virtual) book club meeting,
- did some minor performance optimizations on my website, and
- filed my tax returns. Phew.
