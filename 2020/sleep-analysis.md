# Sleep Analysis

Last summer I got a Garmin 245 smartwatch which tracks sleep and I've been wearing it to bed every night. It's been a year since so I decided to play around with the data captured till now. I downloaded my data from the Garmin Connect website by hitting the right API using [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), did some analysis using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [termgraph](https://github.com/mkaz/termgraph/) and made some charts using [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/).

I like to sleep. I sleep quite a lot. So first chart is the histogram of my sleep duration over last one year:

![Sleep duration histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/duration.svg "Sleep duration histogram")
[Sleep duration histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/duration.svg)

As expected, it is a [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), with a peak around eight hours.

Next is the histogram of my sleep and wakeup times:

![Sleep/wakeup time histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/sleep-wakeup.svg "Sleep/wakeup time histogram")
[Sleep/wakeup time histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/sleep-wakeup.svg)

Again a Normal Distribution, indicating that I usually fall asleep around 10:30 PM and wake up around 7:00 AM.

Here's how my sleep of last one year looks like broken up by sleep stages:

You can see that I'm a pretty light sleeper. Most of my sleep is either light or [REM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep) stages.

Looking at the distribution for sleep duration by stages, here's light and REM stages:

![Light/REM duration histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/light-rem.svg "Light/REM duration histogram")
[Light/REM duration histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/light-rem.svg)

And here's the histogram for deep and awake stage durations:

![Deep/awake duration histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/deep-awake.svg "Deep/awake duration histogram")
[Deep/awake duration histogram](/files/sleep-analysis/deep-awake.svg)

So, I usually have five hours of light sleep and three hours or REM sleep. My deep sleep duration is almost zero and I'm usually awake for 5â€“10 minutes.

It is interesting to get these insights into my sleep patterns. I hope to use it make my sleep even better. Until next time, happy napping!
