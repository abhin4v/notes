# Notes for the week

In the week of 30th Novemberâ€“6th December 2020, I

- spent most of my free time [solving Advent of Code problems](/2020/aoc-wk1) and doing [workouts](https://abhinavsarkar.net/activities/),
- did not read a single page of any book,
- went out for a short stroll around the neighbourhood,
- visited my dear friend [Nivedita](https://twitter.com/nid90/) after 11 months, hung out and had lunch together,
- enjoyed the chilly Bangalore weather by staying in bed longer.
