# Water Intake Chart

I recorded and charted my daily water intake over last one year.

The darker bars are for the weekends and the lighter ones are for the weekdays. The blue line is the fortnightly average.

I captured the data using [this android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northpark.drinkwater). Then I recorded this data in [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/) and made this chart in it.
