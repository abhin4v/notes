# To Meet or Not to Meet

Since I've joined [Flipkart] last year as a software engineer, I've been spending a lot of time in meetings. I decided to analyse all the meetings I've done and categorize them to see if any patterns emerge. These are the categories I've found (in no particular order):

- Knowledge transfer meetings
- Cross-team alignment meetings
- Brainstorming sessions to solve problems
- Project management meetings
  - Project inceptions
  - Project scoping meetings
  - Sync-ups/stand-ups
  - Sprint planning
  - Sprint retrospection
  - Triage meetings
- Requirement gathering meetings
- Demonstrations/showcases/walkthroughs
- Workshops/lectures
- Feedback meetings
- War rooms
  - Big feature launches
  - Big events like sales on e-commerce websites
  - App public launches
  - Production issues
  - Big-bang deployments/migrations
- System/code review meetings
- Interviews
- Pair programming sessions
- Announcements
- Client/vendor pitches

I'll probably analyse them further and write a blog post about them.
