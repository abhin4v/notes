# New Beginnings

I'm starting this website to take short notes about various things and ideas. These notes will be shorter that [my blog articles] but longer than [my tweets]. They probably be about:

- a chapter of a book I just read
- a short code snippet which does some interesting thing
- a new concept or thing I just learned about
- an interesting blog post I just read
- an interesting photo I took

In any case, I'll try to take notes more frequently than I write blog articles. Here's to new beginnings!
